# Pretty Good Flutter App
_Because it's not quite Very Good ;)_

[![Powered by Mason](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmason-badge)](https://github.com/felangel/mason)

A fork of the app made with the [very_good_cli](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli), but removing the multiple environments.


## Getting Started ðŸš€
```sh
mason make pretty_good_flutter_app
```
